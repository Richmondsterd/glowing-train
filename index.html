<h1>Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne site</h1>
<blockquote>"For Lordaeron! For the king!"

<p><i><b>Warcraft 3</b></i> is the best game. It's still relevant. Even though we've finished the game a long ago, it is alive as custom maps are still developed and warcraft community driven. The site is dedicated to fans of the old amazing game what we all love! </p>
